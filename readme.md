<h2>Sajag TCP Protocol is algorithm written in python using the socket module in python 3.8.2</h2>

<p><strong>Sajag TCP Protocol is a open source project which is looking for open source contributors to further enhance the system it is a multiple client handling, through a single server project which uses the ip address of the communicating device to send and recieve messages from different clients to a single server</strong></p>

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>This TCP protocol is completely build on python_3.8.2 and Warning !!!! using any other python version may not work in it i.e. python2 will not work </p>
